/*
 * Week 3 Individual Assignment
 * 
 * Part 1
 * 
 * Design, implement, test, and debug a program with a JFrame that
 * allows the user to enter a series of contactsâ€™ names, ages, e-mail
 * addresses, and cell phone numbers, and creates a file from the
 * entered data. 
 * 
 * Validate the age entry to ensure that it is numeric and
 * between 0 and 120. Include information for three to five contacts.
 * 
 * Part 2
 * 
 * Design, implement, test, and debug a program that reads the file you
 * created by the list in Part 1 and displays the records in a JFrame.
 * 
 * You may either display all entries in the list at once or display them
 * one at a time; the user interface is up to you.
 * 
 * Protect against not being able to open the file.
